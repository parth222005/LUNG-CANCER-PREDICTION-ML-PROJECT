# Cancer Prediction Streamlit Application

## Overview

This Streamlit application is designed to analyze, visualize, and predict cancer levels based on various patient data. It includes several features such as data visualization, prediction, BMI calculation, and feedback submission.

## Features

- **Home**: Provides an introduction to cancer, its symptoms, risk factors, prevention, and treatment options.
- **Visualization**: Allows users to visualize the dataset through different types of plots including histograms, pie charts, box plots, and scatter plots.
- **Make Prediction**: Enables users to input patient data and predict the cancer level using a trained RandomForestClassifier model.
- **BMI Calculator**: Calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input.
- **Feedback Submission**: Allows users to rate the project and provide feedback.
